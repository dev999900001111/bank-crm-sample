## Screen behavior
When the screen is loaded, it retrieves the list of claims and inquiries from the ClaimsService. The ClaimsListComponent displays the list of claims and inquiries in a table format. When a claim or inquiry is selected, the ClaimDetailsDialog is opened, displaying detailed information about the selected claim or inquiry. The ClaimResponseComponent enables salespeople to respond to the selected claim or inquiry. When a response is submitted, the ClaimResponseComponent emits a claimChange event, which updates the selected claim or inquiry in the ClaimsListComponent.
