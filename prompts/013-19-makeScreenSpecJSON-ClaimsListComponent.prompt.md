# Detailed Screen Design Document
## Screen name
Claims List
## Description
The Claims List screen displays a list of all claims and inquiries submitted by customers. The list can be sorted and filtered by various criteria such as date, status, and customer name. The screen also provides a search function to find specific claims. Clicking on a claim in the list opens the Claim Details dialog, which displays more detailed information about the claim and allows the user to respond to it.
## Child Elements

- ClaimDetailsDialog(@Input:{claim: Claim}, @Output:{claimChange: EventEmitter<Claim>})

## Screen layout
The Claims List screen consists of a header, a search bar, and a table displaying the list of claims. The header contains the title of the screen and a button to create a new claim. The search bar allows the user to search for claims by customer name or claim title. The table displays the list of claims with columns for claim title, customer name, date, status, and action buttons. The action buttons allow the user to respond to the claim or view more details about it.
## Screen behavior
- When the screen is loaded, the list of claims is retrieved from the ClaimsService.
- The user can search for claims by entering a search query in the search bar. The list of claims is filtered based on the search query.
- The user can sort the list of claims by clicking on the column headers.
- The user can click on a claim in the list to open the Claim Details dialog.
- The user can respond to a claim from the Claim Details dialog.
- When a claim is responded to, the ClaimsService is called to update the claim status and response.
- When a claim is responded to, the Claims List screen is refreshed to reflect the updated claim status.
